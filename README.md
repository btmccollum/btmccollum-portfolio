# [Brad McCollum](https://www.btmccollum.com)

Hello! My name is Brad McCollum and I'm a software engineer located in Canterbury, CT.

I've spent the last three years working as a full-stack developer, primarily with Ruby 
on Rails and React / Redux. Prior to making a transition to technology, I spent the previous 
seven years as a results-oriented and highly driven manager in the financial services industry.

This page was created from scratch with React.
