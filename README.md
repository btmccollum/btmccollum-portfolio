# [Brad McCollum](http://www.btmccollum.com)

Hello! My name is Brad McCollum and I'm a full-stack web developer located in Fort Worth, Texas.

I'm comfortable throughout the full stack, but lately I've been passionate about the front-end, which has really fed into my passion for coupling code and design.

Currently, I'm pursing a passion for code and looking to transition that into a long and fulfilling career. I've spent the last seven years working in financial services at one of the largest online brokers, most recently serving as a team manager in the backoffice. I graduated from the University of Oklahoma with a degree in Mandarin Language/Literature/Linguistics.
